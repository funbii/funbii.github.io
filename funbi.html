    <h1>Oluwafunbi Ogunlaja</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Oluwafunbi Ogunlaja and I believe that I am the best candidate
      for this university as my passion for Engineering is deep-rooted.
    </p>

    <p>
      My aspirations to become an engineer date as far back as Year 8, where in
      Design Technology we were given the task to build a bridge out of thin
      sticks of wood. We had to design it in such a way that it would be able to
      withstand an increasing stress, forcing us to reconsider the impact that
      internal structure can have on a product's properties. Stress analysis is
      instrumental towards creating functional structures such as buildings,
      bridges, and various other infrastructures.

    <h2>My Love for Physics</h2>
    <p>
      Physics has always been a strong interest of mine as I am enthralled by
      how energy is the basis of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through attending a series of 5 small lectures at the Emmanuel Centre, my
      eyes were opened to topics such as harmonics that I had not even covered
      at school. A particular talk that sparked my interest was one from
      LeahLoveScience who spoke about a fusion project in Oxford, which has the
      potential to change the world.
    </p>

    <h2>GCSEs</h2>
    <p>
      Through attaining a grade 9 in my Level 2 GCSE further mathematics
      qualification, I have discovered that I have a high aptitude for problem
      solving and methodical approaches to real life situations.
    </p>
    <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      I was introduced by a cousin to Quantum Computing after I told him about
      my fascination regarding Quantum Physics. I was lucky enough to be granted
      a full scholarship for IBM's Quantum Computing Course where over the
      course of 6 months I learned Qiskit (a new programming language) and
      simulated programming a Quantum Computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course not only allowed me to get a feel for coding, but it also
      integrated Physics into computing, which I found incredibly fascinating as
      I got to truly understand a real-life application of Quantum Mechanics, a
      topic that really excites me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I learned about Quantum Key Distribution and therefore understood the
      importance of encryption and decryption, but the most intriguing part of
      this common concept was the fact that you could detect inteception of
      messages by measuring the state of a qubit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became more interested in computing and therefore turned to learning
      various different programming languages such as Python and JavaScript.
